# Topic-Recommendation-Model-using-Two-Tower-Architecture



In the contemporary landscape, the Two-Tower model has become prevalent in the retrieval stage of recommendation systems. The architectural concept is straightforward: it comprises two distinct towersâ€”one dedicated to the user and the other to the item, as depicted in the accompanying figure. Leveraging deep neural networks, the model adeptly acquires sophisticated abstract representations for both users and items based on their historical interactions. The ultimate output is the similarity measure between the user's embedding and the item's embedding, reflecting the user's level of interest in the specified item.
